> ### 1. Temperature Measurement System:
#### *Description:*
A Temperature Measurement System created with Arduino Uno on Tinkercad and programmed with C++. Arduino takes every 2.5 seconds the measurement of the temperature sensor, which has been set by the user, and then the temperature is printed on the Serial Monitor while at the same time a led lights up according to the following:
- Red color led: if the temperature is above 25 degrees.
- Blue color led: if the temperature is below 5 degrees.
- Yellow color led: in any other case.

Also, if the user wishes, he can press the button to take a new temperature measurement and then the color of the led will be updated accordingly.

> ### 2. Modern Traffic Light System:
#### *Description:*
A Modern Traffic Light System created with Arduino Uno on Tinkercad and programmed with C++. The traffic light (3 LEDs) changes color every 15 seconds starting with green, then orange and finally red and this process is repeated continuously, like a normal traffic light works. An additional element is a pushbutton for the pedestrian to cross the road faster and safer. If the pedestrian presses the button the traffic light will change color from green to orange and then to red, so he can cross the road.
